# Autonomous Maze Solver 🚀

## Project Overview 🧩
Leveraging the power of reinforcement learning, this project develops an **Autonomous Maze Solver** purely based on reinforcement learning principles.

---

## Workflows ⚙️
1. **Creating `agent.py`**:  
   - Controls the **actor** and **critic** functionalities.  
   - Trains the system from previous mistakes using reward functions.

2. **Creating `model.py`**:  
   - The **actor** performs actions while the **critic** evaluates by giving punishments or rewards.
     
3. **Creating `gymnasium.py`**:  
   - Develops grid structures for the maze environment.

_Note: No traditional machine learning models were created._

## Learning Outcomes 🎓
1. Developed a deeper understanding of reinforcement learning frameworks.  
2. Acquired insights into implementing actor-critic models and reward-driven training systems.
